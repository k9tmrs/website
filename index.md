The K9 Time Measuring & Recording System (or TMRS for short) is an innovative new timing system in the competitive dog sports market.

Primarily aimed at Hoopers, K9 TMRS offers a lower cost alternative to other systems on the market.

By using your own smart phone (Android or iOS) to display timing information we can reduce the cost of the overall system at leas than half the price of competitors!

Not only will timing data be shown on your phone, you will also have the ability of send scores directly to your show processor* for real time updates.

*Only show processors who have signed up for the service will be able to receive live updates.
